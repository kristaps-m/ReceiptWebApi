# ReceiptWebApi

Simple CRUD API to process Receipt resources.

My project could be improved, for example, by adding another database, but then an additional project must be added. 
Also Receipt could be improved, by adding fields like: 'TotalSum', 'CompanyName'.
The product could be improved, by adding a field like: 'Price'.
